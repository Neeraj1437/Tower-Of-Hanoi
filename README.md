# Tower of Hanoi - Java GUI

This is a graphical user interface (GUI) implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem using Java and the Swing library. The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where three rods and a number of disks of different sizes are given. The puzzle's goal is to move all the disks from the source rod to the destination rod, subject to the following rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.
3. A disk may only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty rod.

## Features
- Visual representation of the Tower of Hanoi problem using Java Swing.
- Interactive interface for users to choose the number of disks.
